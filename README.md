# Diabetic-Retinopathy
Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes, caused by high blood sugar levels damaging the back of the eye (retina). It can cause blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated.

The condition affected over 90 million patients. 

The need for a comprehensive and automated method of diabetic retinopathy screening has long been recognized, and previous efforts have made good progress using image classification, pattern recognition, and machine learning. 


# Data
Data is taken from the Kaggle Dataset. Unlike other kaggle datasets, Dataset is imbalanced and not preprocessed properly. Data needs to be preprocessed properly.

# Architecture
Transfer Learning has been used. The training accuracy coming is good according to previous results, around 75%. But the validation accuracy is not high as compared to the training accuracy (around 60%). The model is overfiting. So, feature extraction, parameter will be done. More models will be tested in order to get maximum results.
